    - Mobile nav should be collapsed by default.
    - jQuery window resize.
  - Update favicon for full mobile responsiveness.
- INDEX:
  - Buttons:
    - Style hover effects, colors, size & shape, etc. Create a more appealing call to action.
- CURRENT.HTML:
  - Make input fields taller.
- FORECAST.HTML:
  - Make input fields taller.
- Confirm that Bootstrap folder is no longer used -- and remove it.
- UI:
  - Pressure: Add comma placeholders.
  - Temperature: No decimal places.
  - Change background image/gif according to weather results.
  - Display the DAY OF THE WEEK in the table in place of the somewhat redundant WEATHER DESCRIPTION.
- UX:
  - Allow user to change units between C, F, and K using a dropdown.
  - Put "current" and "forecast" all on the same results page.
    - In fact, put everything on one page -- the home page.
